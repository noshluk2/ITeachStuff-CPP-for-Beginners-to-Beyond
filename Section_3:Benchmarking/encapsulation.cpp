 /* You can fight such complexity with "encapsulation" , a design 
Types 55
pattern that binds data with the functions that manipulate it. Placing related 
functions and data together helps to simplify code in at least two ways. First, 
you can put related code in one place, which helps you to reason about your 
program. You can understand how a code segment works because it describes 
in one place both program state and how your code modifies that state. 
Second, you can hide some of a classâ€™s code and data from the rest of your 
program using a practice called information hiding. 
In C++, you achieve encapsulation by adding methods and access controls to class definitions.*/
